# Giphy-API

This assignment is building a gif generator using ajax, jquery, and javascript to use the Giphy API to populate the page with Star Wars character gifs.

There are 9 premade characters with corresponding buttons for the user to press and populate the page with 10 static images.
Each image can be pressed to animate and each also have a title and rating provide via the API link.

To get more images to show up on the page all one has to do is press the more button on the bottom of the page and 10 more static images will be populated.

Also included is a favorites section that will hide itself upon a click of a button(by default it will hide it's images), with a click of the favorite buttons you can add and remove your selected images to and from the favorites section and they will be saved until you remove them.
